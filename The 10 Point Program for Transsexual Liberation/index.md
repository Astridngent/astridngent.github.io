The following demands are reasonable and actionable demands that seek to improve the material conditions of transsexual people globally. We find these demands to be justified in the face of extreme transsexual oppression.

***1. We Demand the Ability to Determine the Futures of Transsexual People be Placed in the Hands of Transsexual People***

Transsexual people have been systematically excluded from contributing to policy that directly affects our lives. We demand the right to determine what affects our lives, especially when it relates to economic and political decisions that affect our lives and livelihoods. We also demand the right to reserve separation from the state when it makes demands of us that negatively affect our communities.

***2. Right to Adequate Healthcare, Transition Anytime Anywhere***

The exorbitant costs related to transition places undue stress upon transsexual communities and we therefore demand the state provides high quality transition care for free. Included in this demand are all aspects of transition related healthcare currently available and to later be developed. The care we receive must also be fast to access and available with no barriers to access. We also reserve the ability to provide our own communities with adequate care that meets our standards, especially when the state fails to meet our reasonable standards of adequate care. Alongside access to Transition care we demand that our general healthcare be prioritized, the multitude of stressors that affect transsexual people lead to negative health outcomes. In preventing this we demand that steps ate taken to improve our general health outcomes, this can be achieved through providing healthy food, spaces to exercise, mental healthcare and medical care not related to transition.

***3. We demand Complete Economic Independence for All Transsexuals***

Just as other radical organisations have pointed out that the inequality present in society has lead to a siphoning of economic power from marginalized groups we point towards the siphoning of transsexual economic power from transsexual people. It is within the best interests of transsexual people to have their own independent economic power in the form of manufacturing, technology, banking, and trade. By supporting transsexual institutions of economic power we can build transsexual economic freedom. It is because of this that we demand facilitation in building these avenues of economic independence by the state and other institutions.

***4. We Demand Equal and Gainful Employment*** 

Transsexuals are routinely discriminated when it to employment, the work we do have is usually low quality and intermittent. This forces a large amount of transsexual people to turn to sex work to make ends meet. Because of this job discrimination being so severe we demand that the state provides transsexuals with gainful employment to a high degree to counteract the systemic discrimination experienced by transsexuals in both the public and private spheres of employment. Likewise we aim to prioritize transsexuals when it comes to employment and will do our upmost to provide transsexuals with employment wherever possible.

***5. We Reserve the Right to Self Defense by Any Means Necessary*** 

Transsexuals face incredibly high rates of physical and sexual violence by individuals and institutions such as the police and doctors. Because of this heightened risk at the hands of others we reserve the right to protect ourselves and our communities by any means necessary.

***6. We Demand Access to Free and Open Communication***

As transsexuals we are not just a local, we are a global community, and we demand that our ability to fraternize with other transsexuals however, whenever, and wherever we want be supported. This includes the proliferation of both physical and digital third spaces where we can gather and speak freely without fear of monitoring and intervention. These third spaces must be easily accessible and must at all times center transsexuals. In maintaining these third spaces we demand that they not be shut down by outside forces and are actively maintained as places where transsexuals can exist. The accessibility of these spaces is non negotiable and we must strive for all transsexuals to have access to these spaces both digitally and physically, this will be ensured by providing the technology needed to access these spaces whether they are computers or wheelchairs.

***7. We Demand Access to Free Movement and Transportation***

The geographical fracturing of the transsexual community by housing disparities and economic denigration has left the transsexual community separated. The Right to free movement counteracts this fracturing by allowing us to freely gather without undue economic stress. Transportation is a fundamental part of the human experience and as an extremely oppressed group we demand access to free and easy transportation to be able to easily build and maintain the institutions we need to thrive.

***8. We demand Adequate and Free Housing***

Transsexual people are often excluded from consideration when it comes to housing opportunities, both private and public housing have this issue. We also experience discrimination when it comes to homelessness and domestic abuse shelters, where transexual individuals are systematically excluded from shelter. It is because of this we demand the state provides adequate housing for all transsexuals free of charge and within the cities and towns where we can easily access community.

***9. We Demand That We are Remembered*** 

Our histories and cultures are often deliberately forgotten and erased. From the book burnings of Nazi Germany to the erasure of transsexual people (particularly transsexual people of colour) from gay liberation movements to the third sexing of transsexuals globally. It is because of this that we demand our histories be taught to not only transsexual people, but all people of this world. We deserve to have our contributions to the world be remembered on our terms. Our stories and names must be remembered in both life and death.

***10. We Demand Justice for all oppressed people of this world***.

The transsexual is never truly free until all people of this world are liberated. For if a transsexual is black, a woman, mad, or oppressed in any other manner they are still oppressed. It is because of this that we cannot focus our fight exclusively on the liberation of transsexual people. Our movement stands in unequivocal solidarity with other radical movements that seek to liberate oppressed people all across the planet and we operate with the intersections of separate marginalizing oppressions in mind.
