## King and Queen of The Losers

From Boise Idaho we have the soundtrack of my high school life. Scooter and Kiwi hit the perfect balance between dirty and unproduced music with depressing themes that spoke to the 18 year old alcoholic who was catapulting through life in a dangerous trajectory. Their songs were a combination of the feeling of being abandoned by a world that doesn't really care about you, struggling with addiction, and falling in love.

I found myself enraptured by their music, so much so that it became my obsession for a few months as I was quietly going through alcohol withdrawals and when I came out the other end I decided to join their absolutely tiny fandom. Being a fan of such a small band is such a wild experience, you get recognised and given sneak peaks into the behind the scenes of upcoming songs. Listening to the previews and getting so incredibly excited for their upcoming album American Squalor. Listening along to the small online livestream they played when it was released at 4am in Europe is a memory I will hold on until the end of time.

Eventually though, Scooter and Kiwi split apart, and they're no longer making music, I think Kiwi converted to Mormonism under the pandemic, yeah, it's weird. But go check out their music, it's some of the most raw and emotional stuff I have ever listened to.
