# Osteria Alfredo

Osteria Alfredo is a wonderful place to enjoy high quality southern Italian cooking, they put a lot of effort into every dish on their menu and you can taste it with every mouthful you take. Their pizza is the best Neapolitan style pizza I have ever had outside of Napoli, and I eat a lot of pizza. It is also possible to have gluten free pasta and pizza for a small price increase at exactly the same quality as their gluten products, with these meals being made in their own kitchen.
