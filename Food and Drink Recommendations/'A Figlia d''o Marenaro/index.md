# 'A Figlia d''o Marenaro
When a slightly drunk local man at a bar recommends you visit his favourite restaurant you would be remiss to not go and eat there. Serving some of the most delicious and freshest seafood I have ever had this slightly drunken recommendation blew me away. You cannot go to Napoli and not take the time to eat here, at the top of a hill overlooking the old city this restaurant is the epitome of good Neapolitan seafood.
