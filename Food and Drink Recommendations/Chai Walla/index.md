# Chai Walla
No, this is not the chain that you can find all over the UK, this is a tiny little hole in the wall that doesn't even have any seating that specialises in bhaji and dhal wraps that I have attempted to replicate multiple times at home. If you are in Bath this place is a must go for affordable and good food.
