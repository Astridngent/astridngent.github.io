# E Pellici

E Pellici is a café that is just perfect, it has been running for over a century and you can feel that tradition deep in the bones of the café. Serving breakfasts and sandwiches every moment spent here feels like a family lunch on the weekend. The food is also incredibly good, and affordable. Definitely worth your time to find your way out to here and enjoy a breakfast that makes you smile and feel that familial warmth. Just be warned, they only take cash here.
