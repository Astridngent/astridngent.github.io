# Dexter's

Dexter's is a wonderful cocktail bar near the heart of Copenhagen, it is an oasis right next to the hustle and bustle of the city that encourages you to sit down and relax. Every part of this bar from the comfortable seating to the warm lighting is designed to make you comfortable and relaxed. Alongside a wonderful music selection that makes you feel at home in the bar.

The cocktails are also some of the most amazing I have ever had, with bright punchy flavours that dance on the tongue, my personal favourite is the Zanzibar, a refreshingly sweet and tangy drink that is incredibly ginger forward because of the incredibly pungent tangawizi ginger beer used in the cocktail. 

I would highly recommend taking the time to spend an evening here if you are ever in the city, it is a joy and dexter is lovely to chat with.
