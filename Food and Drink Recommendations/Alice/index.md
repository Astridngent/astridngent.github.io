This café and gelateria right next to the lakes on Amager is a wonderful place that focuses on making good quality food and drink from high quality ingredients. It is a bit on the pricey side of things, but as a treat I find myself buying a pastry from here. Worth a trip if you can afford it, but not a must go for copenhagen.
