# The Pond

You know how back on Tumblr you would find like, a million posts going "I wish there was a cosy space to hang out with queer people that didn't involve alcohol, maybe like a bookstore or a café"? Well The Pond is exactly one of those spaces, and alongside being both a café and a queer bookstore that has a myriad of books from the most grotesque horror to zines on flagging and cosy YA stories about knights it is a third space that is open to just existing in without having to pay for entry.
