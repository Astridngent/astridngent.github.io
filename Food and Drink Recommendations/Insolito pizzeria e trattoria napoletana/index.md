# Insolito pizzeria e trattoria napoletana
Tucked away in a corner of the old town in Napoli you'll find this pizza place that specialises in neopolitan pizza. I found this place wandering the alleys after having landed in Napoli a few hours earlier and dropping my bags off at my hotel. Exhausted, slightly grumpy, and incredibly hungry I had one of the best pizza's of my life here. Throughout my trip to Napoli I found myself constantly returning to eat here again and again.
