One of the few good memories I have surrounding my time in Hamilton is getting take away from here as often as I possibly could. They have won multiple awards and each and every one of them is deserved.  They do not pull their punches when it comes to spice and if you order extra they will give you an experience to die for, I highly recommend getting the goat curry as it is incredibly tender and sweet with such a beautiful sauce that I wish I still lived near there.
