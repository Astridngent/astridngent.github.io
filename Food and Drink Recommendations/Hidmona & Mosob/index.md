## Hidmona & Mosob

Instead of a single restaurant I am recommending two restaurants that neighbour each other.  Both specialise in Ethiopian and Eritrean food and both do it well. Growing up with easy access to the most amazing Eritrean and Ethiopian food meant that when I moved to Europe I found myself yearning for the food that I grew to love in Africa, and it took a long time for me to find a place where I could enjoy good quality food, both restaurants filled the niche that I was looking to fill. 

If you want a warm meal to share with others and find yourself in Nørrebro you should definitely make the journey out to one of these neighbouring restaurants.
