# Torvets Kebab

This Kebab place is one of my major go to places for enjoying a nice cheap takeout on a day out in town. They have high quality bred, meat, falafel and they actually listen when I tell them to pile on the spice. What more is there to ask for when slightly exhausted, possibly drunk, and hanging out with your friends.
