# Love Shack

The only time I ate here at Love Shack was with my ex girlfriend and her fiancée, and although the people I spent it with are no longer folks I have much connection to the food is still something I find myself thinking of to this day. They focus on vegan food and every single meal I have had there has been to die for. I ordered the full english and every single element on the plate was delicious, well made, and most importantly made me feel much better after having travelled for hours to be there.
