# List of Transfeminist Sources
 This list is in inexhaustive and incomplete list over sources that I consider decent for developing a transfeminist framework of analysis when it comes to examining transfeminine oppression and positionality within society. containing a collection of material sources and analytical ones. Each source is formatted with the Chicago manual of style and sorted alphabetically. I Have also collated a collection of fundamental feminist sources that I believe are important to developing a solid foundation to build transfeminist understanding.

**!! IMPORTANT !!:**
H.A.L. is a tumultuous text as it has been used to smokescreen sexual abuse and assault, I still recommend reading this essay as it is an incredibly informative _trauma_ literature work that gives a good insight into the psychological stress that the author was experiencing at the height of GamerGate. It also touches on the concept of transfeminine labour and disposability as a parrales to racialised and feminised labour and disposability. If you decide to work with this source be aware of how it is used culturally.
