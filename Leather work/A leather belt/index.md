\# A simple leather belt



This belt was made for a friend of mine who who had a shitty and disintegrated grommeted leather belt. This belt was a gift of sorts, but also a project where i could test new techniques for making handcrafted leather goods. Each steel grommet is hand punched and hammered into place, turning the creation of the belt into a meditative process where I became immersed in the task at hand.
