Here I have collated my different transfemminist writings that I have put together in the hopes of having a single repository that I can just point people to whenever they want to read something I have written on the subject. 

### ◬ [An Argument Against Stealth](An Argument Against Stealth)
Within this post I argue about the merits of not going complete stealth, and how community is fostered when you don't try to hide your transness. 

### ◬ [The 10 Point Program for Transsexual Liberation](The 10 Point Program for Transsexual Liberation)
My manifesto and the guiding principles for my transexual activism.

### ◬ [Feminism and the Transfeminine](Feminism_and_the_Transfeminine)
Exploring the relationship between traditional feminism and transfeminism, and how they come into conflict.

### ◬ [Recuperation and Transfeminine Trauma Narratives in Contemporary Literature](Recuperation_and_Transfeminine_Trauma_Narratives_in_Contemporary_Literature)
My Bachelor's dissertation on transfeminine trauma narratives, it explores how transfeminine trauma is used as a bridging gap to build empathetic connection between the transfeminine subject and other people.

### ◬ [On Transgender Consent](On Transgender Consent)
My musings on consenting to the body I have and all the ways that I as a trans person am denied consent.

### ◬ [A Brief Anthropological Study of The Cisfatalist](A Brief Anthropological Study of The Cisfatalist)
Originally a longform high effort shitpost poking fun at western anthropology from the perspective of a world that is primarily centred around transsexuals I inadvertently came with a piece of satire upon a certain type of person that is apparently common.
